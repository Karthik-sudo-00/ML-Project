Project Title: Data Science Salary Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview:
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the salary of data science professionals based on various features such as experience, education, location, skills, and other relevant factors. By utilizing regression algorithms, the goal is to create an accurate model that can estimate the annual salary for a data scientist based on historical data.
Objective:
The primary objective is to design and implement a machine learning model that can predict the salary of data science professionals. This can help job seekers, recruiters, and businesses make data-driven decisions about compensation, hiring trends, and salary benchmarking.

Key Features for Prediction:
1. Work_year	
2. Experience	
3. Employment_type	
4. Job_title	salary	
5. Salary_currency	
6. Salary_in_usd	
7. Employee_residence	
8. Remote_ratio	
9. Company_location	
10. Company_size
Approach:
1. Data Collection: Gather a large dataset of data science job profiles from various online job portals (e.g., LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed), Kaggle, or other open datasets.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing data, remove irrelevant features, convert categorical features to numeric (e.g., one-hot encoding for job titles and locations), and normalize numerical features where necessary.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze correlations between salary and other features, visualize distributions, and check for any outliers or patterns.
4. Feature Engineering: Create new features or refine existing ones to improve model performance (e.g., calculating years of experience from job start and end dates).
5. Model Selection: Experiment with various regression models such as: LINEAR REGRESSION
6. Model Training and Tuning: Train multiple models on the training data and use techniques like cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning (GridSearch, RandomSearch), and feature selection to optimize performance.
7. Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-Squared to ensure the modelâ€™s accuracy and robustness.
8 .Deployment (Optional): Deploy the model as a web service or API using platforms like Flask, Streamlit, or FastAPI for users to input their data and get salary predictions.

Expected Outcome:
A machine learning model capable of accurately predicting a data science professional's salary based on various features. This tool could be used to assist in salary negotiations, job searching, and compensation analysis. The model's performance will be evaluated based on prediction accuracy and generalizability to unseen data.
Skills and Tools:
> Programming Languages: Python, R
> Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, TensorFlow (optional for deep learning)
> Tools: Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, GitHub.
> Data Sources: Kaggle Datasets, Glassdoor API, LinkedIn API.
> Cloud Platforms (Optional): AWS, Google Cloud for deployment.

Conclusion:
This project will provide valuable insights into the factors influencing salary trends in data science, empowering job seekers with knowledge to make informed career decisions and helping companies align their compensation strategies with market trends.
